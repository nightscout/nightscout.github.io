Health professional? You might not want to build a Nightscout site and just need to find out how to get data from it, [jump to the dedicated pages here](/clinicians/home/).

</br>

## Introduction

Nightscout (also known as CGM in the Cloud) is an open-source cloud application used by people with diabetes and parents of kids with diabetes to visualize, store and share the data from their Continuous Glucose Monitoring sensors in real-time. Once setup, Nightscout acts as a central repository of blood glucose and insulin dosing/treatment data for a single person, allowing you to view the CGM graph and treatment data anywhere using just a web browser connected to the internet.

There are several parts to this system. You need somewhere online to store, process and visualize this data (a Nightscout Site), something to upload CGM data to your Nightscout (an Uploader), and then optionally you can use other devices to access or view this data (one - or more - Follower).

### Nightscout Site

- The Nightscout cloud application can be installed by yourself (Do It Yourself, in short: DIY) using hosting services from various cloud service providers.
- You can also pay to use a fully-managed Nightscout hosting service and avoid having to personally build and maintain your site.

### Uploader

The CGM data is usually sent to Nightscout by an uploader device such as a mobile cellphone running an app like xDrip+, Spike, xDrip4iOS, Medtronic Uploader and others. Alternatively, the CGM data can be pulled directly from your online Dexcom account. The application you'll need for uploading the data depends on which CGM device you're using and what type of mobile device you have.

### Followers

In addition to viewing the data using a web browser, there are also applications available for mobile devices, smartwatches, electronic devices and other cloud-based services which allow you alternative ways to view and interact with the information stored within your Nightscout site (often known as "Followers").

## Development History

Nightscout was developed by people with Type 1 Diabetes and parents of kids with T1D and has continued to be developed, maintained, and supported by volunteers, clinical use, and commercial sponsorship. The web portal known as Nightscout is made by the [CGM Remote Monitor Contributors](https://github.com/nightscout/cgm-remote-monitor/graphs/contributors) and the Nightscout community over years.

When first implemented, Nightscout was a solution specifically for remote monitoring of [Dexcom G4 CGM data](https://github.com/hackingtype1/original-android-cgm). Today, there are Nightscout solutions available for nearly all commercial CGM sensors. The goal of the project is to allow the remote monitoring, sharing and analysis of any T1D's glucose levels using existing monitoring devices.

## What are the values of Nightscout

We are compelled in the pursuit of **humane** and **equitable** application of technology to **liberating people from the burden of diabetes**. We are not waiting to deliver the benefits we've found in **sharing _all_ diabetes experiences**. Nightscout is free to contribute, free to access, free to criticize, free to try, free to depend on, free to modify, and free to distribute. The Nightscout community demands **respect** and **dignity** for all community members. The reputation of the Nightscout community is affected by the **quality** of the source code, the quality of our relationships, the quality of our discussions, what we are known for doing: the way we treat each other.
Users of Nightscout are impacted by **reliability**, **security** and **confidentiality** of Nightscout. Therefore, the developers and contributors of Nightscout strive to improve the quality of Nightscout while making these opportunities **accessible** to all.

Nightscout's **longevity**, the application, the ecosystem, and the culture demand we use all tools at our disposable to achieve the values in a **sustainable** way. We are not waiting to do whatever it takes to meet the needs of people affected by the inhumane demands of diabetes. Our active **collaboration** against the burden of diabetes creates the results we desire.

## What Do I Need?

You will need:

- A CGM sensor

- A way to [upload](uploader/uploaders) your data, to be stored in Nightscout (this is generally an internet-connected mobile phone with a matching uploader app)

- Internet access

- **<u>For Nightscout DIY:</u>** Basic computer skills and the ability to **_carefully_** follow the installation guides shown on this site

  **\*"Carefully"** means that you will thoroughly read, follow and complete each step without skipping any and without giving up thinking that it is too difficult - it isn't, you just need to be patient.\*

```{admonition} IMPORTANT
:class: danger

Before using Nightscout, it is important to understand that this project:

- is an open-source, community-based project and is not supported by any company
- is not officially approved or regulated for diabetes therapy and/or treatment in any way

**If you will be using DIY: You must understand that you take full responsibility for building and running this system and you agree to do so at your own risk.**
```

```{admonition} SAFETY
:class: danger

- This project requires a working internet connection and availability of third-party cloud services
- Do not rely only on Nightscout as the only way you have of knowing your blood glucose values and trends
- Make sure you're ready to cope with an unexpected failure and always have alternative ways to check your blood glucose levels
```

## How Much Does It Cost?

There's no simple answer to this. You basically have two options:

1. **[DIY](#build-your-own-nightscout-site)**: Use instructions on this website to create your own installation. You will need to maintain this installation yourself. There are cloud providers that offer the needed hosting services for free, so your monthly hosting cost can be free - $0 with this option. Of note, with this option you are the person responsible for ensuring the service is up when you need it. The community aims to support people who choose this option, but this is entirely driven by a voluteer effort and support might not be available when you need it.
2. **[Use a service](#nightscout-as-a-service)**: You can use a hosting provider that does all of this work for you in exchange for a monthly fee. There are many options available for this. If you're a non-technical person, this is a **great choice**.

## Build your own Nightscout site

```{tip}
</br><span style="font-size:larger;">Interested in building a Nightscout DIY site? You'll find instructions ⇒ [**HERE**](/nightscout/new_user/) ⇐.</span></br></br>
```

**Note:** DIY users of Nightscout have been historically using platforms like [Digital Ocean](https://github.com/jasoncalabrese/project-glu/blob/master/README.md), [Microsoft Azure](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RP-0KAX0Z46iGmShBdygY7_vQN1d-xEgtK_dSsjCA20/edit) and then Salesforce Heroku to host their sites. With time, more platforms were added, but most now charge for usage.

If you have the time to author instructions for this purpose, new documentation [pull requests](https://github.com/nightscout/nightscout.github.io/pulls?q=is%3Apr) are extremely welcome as well as [comments](https://github.com/nightscout/nightscout.github.io/issues).

## Who can help me with my DIY Nightscout?

You will find many willing and open-hearted people in the Facebook groups.

The main group for all Nightscout support is the "[CGM in the Cloud](https://www.facebook.com/groups/cgminthecloud/)" Facebook group.

There are also many local Nightscout communities and you'll probably be able to find one in your own country and language if this helps.

```{admonition} Technical Support
:class: warning

Unless you're paying for a hosted Nightscout including support, this project is "**Do It Yourself**" (DIY) and supported by volunteers. Whilst you will almost certainly always will find someone ready to help you for free, building your own Nightscout site **doesn't entitle you to any form of support** from anybody.

The open-source diabetes movement is founded on the idea of **paying it forward** and helping others to learn things that others took their time to help teach you about.

*Ask nicely, and nice people will always do nice things and help you.*

Nightscout developers are busy people and we'd like them to concentrate on maintaining and improving Nightscout, not only supporting users. (This means **do not** send them private messages or friend requests just to help fix something that is already clearly documented or for help that can be easily requested in the CGM in the Cloud group)
```

```{admonition} Facebook Privacy
:class: tip

You'll find a lot of useful and friendly diabetes-oriented groups on Facebook and it's probably the best place to find online support. Some people express concerns about using Facebook: if you're worried about your privacy just remember Facebook will only share the information that you **allow** it to share.
