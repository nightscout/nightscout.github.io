# Cleanup

After unsuccessful attempts you might want to cleanup the various accounts to avoid confusion.

If you're still trying to deploy your first Nightscout, ignore all data loss recommendations below.

If you have a large amount of CGM data, be extra cautious when performing Atlas cleanup.

## [GitHub](https://github.com/login)

The most efficient way to cleanup GitHub and restart with an up-to-date Nightscout project is to [redeploy](/update/redeploy.md) it.

You will then need to reconnect your repository to [Heroku](/troubleshoot/heroku.md#cannot-find-cgm-remote-monitor-in-heroku-item-cannot-be-retrieved) or [Railway](/troubleshoot/railway.md#reconnect-github-to-your-project).
