## Lost access to GitHub

Not a big problem, just create another account if you can't recover access to the original one:

### Create a GitHub account

```{include} /vendors/github/create.md

```

You'll need to reconnect your app to GitHub.

## Cannot update GitHub

When encountering update issues with GitHub, the easiest method it to delete it and fork the project again.

### Delete your own fork of cgm-remote-monitor

```{include} /vendors/github/delete.md

```

### [Fork the Nightscout project](/troubleshoot/github.md#fork-the-nightscout-project)

You'll need to reconnect your app to GitHub.
