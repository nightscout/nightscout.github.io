DIA is the duration of the [insulin action](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4454113/). 

Carbs absorption rate is [complex](https://diyps.org/2014/05/29/determining-your-carbohydrate-absorption-rate-diyps-lessons-learned/) to calculate for patients and can be undefined (or zero) if the DIY system doesn't update the value (when existing).

Insulin to Carbs ratio (IC) and Insulin Sensitivity Factor (ISF) can be defined by time periods. Only one visible value means whole day.

Basal rates should match the pump settings.
