## New Nightscout Setup

</br>

a) Your Nightscout site should open and direct you to a new profile creation.

</br>

b) Setup your `Time zone` and eventually all other fields. Do not leave any fields empty. If you don't know which value to use, just use the default value. You can change these values later at any time.
